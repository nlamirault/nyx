Package cairo is a Golang wrapper for the Cairo graphics library.  
Copyright 2015 Google Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(Not an official Google project.)

This wrapper is unique among Cairo wrappers in that it is generated by
parsing the C API header, and then massaged from there into a Go-style
API.  This ensures the wrapper is consistent and complete.

## Install

If you're lucky this will work:

    go get github.com/martine/gocairo/cairo

but Cairo can be built many different configurations (e.g. it can be
built with or without Xlib or PNG etc. support), so it's likely you'll
need to `git clone` this repository instead and run `make` to have the
build process autodetect your system's configuration.
